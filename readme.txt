The config page lets you choose the size of the cartoon image and the border thickness.
The plugin comes with a widget to make it easy to integrate the cartoon on your sidebar.

== Installation ==

1. unzip wp-cartoon.zip to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Press the "add cartoon" button on any page or post to insert the cartoon
3. Or add the cartoon widget to your sidebar

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I choose a cartoon size bigger than 500px wide? =

Yes you can, but the cartoon will get blurry as 500px is the native size.

= Can I use the cartoon on my commercial site? =

You can do that only if you purchase a license for commercial use.
Please email dan@danscartoons.com with specific information or questions you might have.
